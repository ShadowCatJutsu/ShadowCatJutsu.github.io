    </p>
    <p>Hi, I'm Chai! I am a <strong>self-taught</strong> developer who <em>loves</em> puzzles, stories, and coffee.</p>
    <h3>My Goals in Pursuing a Career in Software Development</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Why do I want to learn these skills?
        <ol>
          <li>I admire people who can take logic and art and create something useful</li>
          <li>I want to have a flexible career</li>
          <li>I find myself working jobs that have steep learning curves but no room for personal growth</li>
          <li>I can't wait to find an environment of like-minded people so that we may grow together</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>How will this skill change my life and my career?
        <ol>
          <li>Ultimately I would like to find a job that allows for creativity and collaboration</li>
          <li>I hopefully will have the freedom to travel more with my husband</li>
          <li>I want to be able to work on a variety of projects and challenge myself in the process</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>What would my life look like if I manage to accomplish this?
        <ol>
          <li>I would love to find a workplace with similar values to my own and an engaging culture that promotes growth, collaboration, and creativity</li>
          <li>Ideally, I would be working remotely so that I may travel freely</li>
          <li>My husband and I could collaborate on projects and I would finally understand his "tech babble"</li>
          <li>I would be able to build and add flair to my favorite puzzles like Sudoku and Binary Dots</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ul>
